Sometimes, additional work on the user interface is performed after the MVP stage. In other cases, there is a delay between the two stages. In a few instances, the MVP is so good that the client reduces the product's scope, saving thousands of dollars without compromising the user's experience. "},"summeryMVP":{"type":"string","value":"Our primary goal is to ensure your product performs. Before a full launch, we help you develop a simple product that allows you to beta test with your first clients. You'll collect data and implement the necessary changes to improve your product before long and expensive development. In this step, our team develops the critical features of your product based on your budget, allowing you to manage the project's risks correctly.

We want to recreate the delight you had when you first launchedâ€”everything you tried to explain in your pitch meetings, presentations, and formulas, displayed with crystal clarity. From the second your team meets investors, you'll be able to walk them through the concepts with a stunning display. Based on our experience, meaningful investments are dependent on the performance of a POC.
